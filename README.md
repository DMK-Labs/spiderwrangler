# Spiderwrangler

A Clojure library designed to wrangle data spun into place by web crawling 'spiders'.

## Usage

This is a [boot](http://boot-clj.com) project. If a `project.clj` is required for `lein`
compatibility in your editor ([Counterclockwise](http://doc.ccw-ide.org)
or [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com)), run `boot lein/generate` in the project root
directory.

Currently, the library is designed for interactive use (i.e. in a REPL or your
editor's interactive eval), meant for an audience of newcomers to Clojure.
Navigate to `spiderwrangler.core` namespace and eval away!
